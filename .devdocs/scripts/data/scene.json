    "description": "A medium close-up shot of a friendly African professional chef with a beard, wearing a crisp blue apron and a tall white chef's hat. He is smiling warmly and looking directly into the camera in a well-lit, modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances. He says energetically: \"Hey everyone, and welcome back! Today, we're mastering the absolute basics: how to properly dice an onion.\". The scene is filmed from a front-facing perspective, in a realistic, 4k, high quality, vlog style.",
